# FreeDMS - technical intro

All this shall be realized by scripts that provide an API for the most common operating systems. It should be a lightweight layer above the operating system that anyone can easily add to his OS. The standard folders shall be localized later. So _legals might appear as "Rechtliches" in german and as "Legal affairs" in english. The user might even be able to call folders his own way. 

Once these scripts exist, programs can start to use this structures.
  * A file-browser could show such folders that do not exist yet in a semi-transparent way or with special icons. If you place a file in such a non existing folder, this folder is created. This way your projects are not filled up with a bunch of empty folders by default. 
  * The filebrowser also might (if I like that) show all my documents directly without the proposed structure of folders. He kind of "hides" the folders and just shows additional icons on my files that indicate if they are in _finance/_sales or in _legal. 
  * A mail-client could read out tags attached to documents and send attachments to the appropriate folders or place mails into the _communications folder.
  * A financial software could collect all the data from the _finance folders all over the project.
  * Photos could be placed into a _documentation/_images folder.
