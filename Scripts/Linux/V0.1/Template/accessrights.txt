This document explains the rights managememnt of freeDMS

1) Each project has various roles.
    r_admin      has access to all directories of a project.
                 may create and delete all directories and files.
                 may manage the access-rights of all directories and files.
                 may define and assign additional roles for his project.
                 may create subprojects and assign r_admins for these.
                 They will be the r_master of all their sub projects.
    r_team       have restricted rights for some directories by default.
                 sometimes have writing righs for files created by themself but
                 might have just reading rights for files created by others.
                 may create directories in some directories.
    r_private    A r_admin might assign enhanced or restricted rights to some
                 team members. The'll inherit these rights also in sub projects.
    r_master     is the r_admin of the super project.
                 As a project typically is embedded as subproject into a superproject,
                 there is always a admin of the super project.
                 The r_admin must be team-member of this super project.
    r_extern     someone from outside.
                 has restricted reading and writing rights to some view directories.

2) There are some super-roles that a r_admin may not assign.
    r_superadmin may assign the super-roles. (typically a sys admin)
                 may define the heritage system.
                 the heritag system might be different in various sub projects.
                 (think of different departments in a company)
    r_supervisor There might be team members in a subproject 
                 that are not team members of the super project.
                 A supervisor may have access-rights to all (or restricted) 
                 directories of all the r_admins and r_team of subprojects. 
    r_superinfo, r_freeDMSdirectoryname  these roles have 
    r_finance,   access to a dedicated level 1 directory and all its subdirectories.
    r_law,       A mailclient might have acces to _communication
    ...          A finance-software might have access to _finance
                 and so on.

2) Roles are automatically enherited to subprojects and created when a new project
   is created. The task of the r_admin is to assign or deassign team members to
   a subproject. 
   By default, all team members of the master project will be assigned to a sub project.
   If a person is removed from a team, this person is also removed from all subprojects.

Exemples:
   My private computer with some additional user-profiles (like my family members).
   The computer admin typically is also the 
       r_admin of the main projects directory and thus also the 
       default r_admin of all sub projects. They are also the
       r_superadmin of their private computer, but typically will not use this role.
   The children might be kind of r_team while the
