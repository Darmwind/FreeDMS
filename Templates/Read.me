The following templates are necessary:
  * Template          The main template
  * Template_Member   A template for the _name-folders inside _team
  * _0_admin          This is just a dummy for relative inside the Template to work

The numbers in the folder-names are an attempt to keep all the freeDMS together and to bring them into a somehow logical order.
