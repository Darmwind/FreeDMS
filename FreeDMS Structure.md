  	    _documents      documentation, reports, ...
  	    _web            things to be published

Additionally every main folder contains an hidden folder _appdata. 
Applications may deposit their (for the user not readable) data like settings, binary files, ...

It's all about a good overview *for the user*. 
An application has no troubles to step deeper into a path by two additional folders.
